        Over the years that Tenth Ward Computing has been in business, we have encountered organizations that provide
        aids to other <br><br>


        As we provide services throughout the area, we encounter organizations that help others. Typically not-for
        profit, these groups often have severely limited resources; nonetheless, they, like most organizations today,
        require information technology in order to function effectively.

        Because these same groups provide valuable services to the community as a whole and often help those most in
        need, they, in turn, need and deserve our help.<br><br>

        For this reason, TenthWard Computing makes available to such organizations assistance in the area of
        information technology.

        At times, we make outright donations of software and/or hardware. At other times, we assist with the low cost
        donation of services and/or computing products.<br><br>

        To be sure our resources are limited; nonetheless if your organization is in need, please contact us as we may
        be able to help.

        Similarly, if you or your organization would like to provide help, contact us as together we may be able to
        serve those who serve others. </p>
