        Over the years that Tenth Ward Computing has been in business, we have encountered organizations that provide
        aids to others. <br><br>


        As we provide services throughout the area, we encounter organizations that help others. Typically not-for
        profit, these groups often have severely limited resources; nonetheless, they, like most organizations today,
        require information technology in order to function effectively.

        Because these same groups provide valuable services to the community as a whole and often help those most in
        need, they, in turn, need and deserve our help.<br><br>

        For this reason, TenthWard Computing makes available to such organizations assistance in the area of
        information technology.

        At times, we make outright donations of software and/or hardware. At other times, we assist with the low cost
        donation of services and/or computing products.<br><br>

        To be sure our resources are limited; nonetheless if your organization is in need, please <a href="contact.html"
          class="links">contact us</a> as we may
        be able to help.

        Similarly, if you or your organization would like to provide help, <a href="contact.html" class="links">contact
          us</a> as together we may be able to
        serve those who serve others. </p>
